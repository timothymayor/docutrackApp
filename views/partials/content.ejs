<!-- Write a logic that will dynamically change the content of this page based on controller parameters -->
<!-- for instance we know that the controller passes a variable called title -->
<!--Use this title to change the content of each page based on the route-->
<!--All content should be placed here for now-->
<!--Cleaner View Code - Everything has been seprated -->

<!--DOCUMENT CONTENT-->
<%- include ('../content/document-content') %>
<!--EMPLOYEE CONTENT-->
<%- include ('../content/employee-content') %>

<!--CATEGORY CONTENT-->
<%- include ('../content/category-content') %>
<!--APPLICATION CONTENT-->
<%- include ('../content/application-content') %>
<!--TYPE CONTENT-->
